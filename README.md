# Job Assignments

This github repository contains a variety of python files used in job interview assignments over the years. 

## DriveTime
The DriveTime Assignment requested that I build a model predicting first year delinquency rates based on 13 credit attributes, with a focus on maximizing cross-validated ROC AUC. They also requested that I implement a pipeline allowing predictions from the trained model to be made on new data. I distributed the findings as a streamlit app, [which can be found here](https://drivetime-presentation.herokuapp.com/) or in the DriveTime folder titled "streamlit_app.py"

## Deloitte
The Deloitte assignment provided me with a file of data regarding race times, reorganize and clean the data, and then present some visualizations in the dashboarding tool of your choice. They also requested that I conduct some basic statistical analyses comparing groups of people. The results of this analysis can be found in the Deloitte folder titled "Assignment Presentation.pbix"

## Klaviyo
The Klaviyo assignment provided me with a file of data and requested that I read it, sort it, and do some very basic data visualization and statistical analysis. It was an incredibly trivial task, but somehow I did not make the cut. I'm not salty at all. There was no presentation portion, so all of the results are in the Klaviyo folder, titled "York Exercise Solutions.ipynb" 

## DFPS
The DFPS assignment provided a datasest regarding placement for placed into convservatorship with the CPS. The assignment requested that I analyze this data to located the geographical region most in need, using whatever definition of "need" we thought most appropritate.
